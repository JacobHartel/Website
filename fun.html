            <li>The Creative Act... Rick Rubin : It took a while to find the lesson in this book. I am a muscician and I sketch but this book helped me realize I am sometimes in that mental space when doing technical work and it allowed me to save it for my hobbies rather than distracting myself</li>
            <li>Make Something Wonderful - Steve Jobs : This is a collection of Steve's words and it just inspires you to do more than you believe you're capable of. Which isn't completely true, no one ever knows their limitations, not even Mr. Jobs</li>

            <li>Tools of Titans - Timothy Ferriss : Tim Ferriss is one of those people that lures me in on anything he writes, because it's done so well. In this book it's an eye opening peek at the habits and mindsets of the most successful people</li>
            <li>Atomic Habits - James Clear : Even if you're not trying to improve your habits this book, at least, can help you stop negative habits from forming in the first place</li>
            <li>The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horrowitz : This starts as a memoir, showing the badges of honor from the "battlefield" of business. Then goes into a great view of management and business from a real empathic viewpoint. He takes great care in considering the workplace he creates for his employees.</li>
            <li>Tribe of Mentors - Timothy Ferriss : This will be the last one I reccommend for Tim Ferriss. Just assume I reccommend them all. Great advice and something you can leave on the coffee table for a pick me up</li>
            <li>Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman : This book dives into the differences of our thinking mind. Largely between the quick generative thoughts and the long pondering sessions.</li>
