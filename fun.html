    <h1>Book Recommendations</h1>
    <ul class="bookList">
      <li>The Sea Wolf - Jack London : This book is in the top 5 just because the age and enviroment of my consumption
      </li>
      <li>The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch : This book is hard to read haha. It's a lot but it brings a deeper
        perspective of reality</li>
      <li>Tesla: A Wizard at War - Marc J. seifer : Not as dire as it sounds but an interesting look into one of the
        greatest minds in history</li>
      <li>Red Rising - Pierce Brown : Amazing sci-fi terraforming thriller, there are about 6 books at this point and it
        rivals the greats</li>
      <li>Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling : It's Harry Potter, this series got me reading when I was younger, a sense of
        wonder.</li>
      <li>The Creative Act - Rick Rubin : It took a while to find the lesson in this book. I am a muscician and I sketch
        but this book helped me realize I am sometimes in that mental space when doing technical work and it allowed me
        to save it for my hobbies rather than distracting myself</li>
      <li>Make Something Wonderful - Steve Jobs : This is a collection of Steve's words and it just inspires you to do
        more than you believe you're capable of. Which isn't completely true, no one ever knows their limitations, not
        even Mr. Jobs</li>
      <li>Read Write Own - Chris Dixon : This is an amazing historical record of the internet and how it operated. It
        also dives into the future of the internet and possiblities for Web3.</li>
      <li>Tools of Titans - Timothy Ferriss : Tim Ferriss is one of those people that lures me in on anything he writes,
        because it's done so well. In this book it's an eye opening peek at the habits and mindsets of the most
        successful people</li>
      <li>Atomic Habits - James Clear : Even if you're not trying to improve your habits this book, at least, can help
        you stop negative habits from forming in the first place</li>
      <li>The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horrowitz : This starts as a memoir, showing the badges of honor from
        the "battlefield" of business. Then goes into a great view of management and business from a real empathic
        viewpoint. He takes great care in considering the workplace he creates for his employees.</li>
      <li>Tribe of Mentors - Timothy Ferriss : This will be the last one I reccommend for Tim Ferriss. Just assume I
        reccommend them all. Great advice and something you can leave on the coffee table for a pick me up</li>
      <li>Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman : This book dives into the differences of our thinking mind. Largely
        between the quick generative thoughts and the long pondering sessions.</li>
      <li>Chainsaw Man - Tasuki Fujimoto: This is a manga and yes the name sounds a little hyperbolic but he's not
        always a chainsaw man, sometimes he's just a kid trying to navigate life. Great book(series)!</li>
      <li>Meditations - Marcus Aurelius: This might be a little cliche, but often things are cliche for a reason and
        this is one of those books.</li>
      <li>Man's Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl: This is an insanely good book, it might possibly be the only good to
        come from the camps. A must read for anyone. </li>
      <li>Everything is F**ked - Mark Manson: As usual he writes catchy titles, the thing is this is an awesome book
        about shifting your frame, highly reccommend.</li>
      <li>Lou Reed, A Life - Anthony Decurtis: Anythony decurtis is one of the greats in biographies, if you have any
        interest in the Velvet Underground of the New York culture in the 70s-80s this is a must read. It's a little
        dark and depraved but that's what make's Lou's turn around later in life so inspirational.</li>
      <li>No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Elearnor Roosevelt - Doris Kearns Goodwin: This is a powerful book and if you
        have any interest in American history you should take a weekend.</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>Constantly adding more books, stay tuned!</li>
    </ul>
