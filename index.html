    <h1>On My Mind 7/12/24</h1>
    <p class="interests">Lately I have really been wanting to get into embedded systems programming. I enjoy the
      physical feedback loop.
      Sometimes the things I program don't have much tangible effect, or atleast ones I can see and make better sense
      of. I may end up getting a raspberry pi and
      some motors and try to build a rudimentary car or maybe something more exciting. This would be a win-win, both
      entertaining and helps me to expand my programming skills.
      Obviously I would use Rust...just because I still don't understand the language as much as I'd like. Building a
      discord bot is really simple and with the library they have, it's not
      much of an introduction to the language. From what I've seen the embedded systems usage of Rust is where it really
      shines. I watched someone build a simple robotic 'arm' with rust and it
      seemed really involved. Plus being 'close to the metal' always calls to me in ways standard software never has.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p class="interests">Do I really want to build a car though? I'm trying to 'carve my own path' in terms of interests
      because at the end of the day, this is going to be my career. The path
      I choose now could heavily influence my future and I want to make sure I actually have some interests in the
      technology. Another point I've been thinking about is the future. Even if everything ends up under
      the control of artificial intelligence they will need a way to interact with the systems. With new devices and
      products they won't beable to simply generate the code without specific knowledge about the systems.
      At the very least they will need an environment and a path to the hardware.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p class="interests">Who knows though, AI could hit a wall this year, or it might continue to scale. I worry about
      this problem day to day. The truth is nobody really has a clear picture, and believe me I have been looking.
      The best we can do is put one foot in front of the other and be realistic. How many times has a new technology
      come along in a hype cycle? How many times have large portions of jobs been in trouble by technology? We are still
      working
      still doing our best, day in day out. I just hope that help AI provides across all industries and helps us do more
      with less. So we can create value that isn't just about profits. Don't get me wrong I love profits but I also
      enjoy
      seeing unintended side effects that are a boon to society. I think that is possible and with AI it's already
      happening. People are learning more, interacting thanks to it's translations. It's still early and I am hopeful.
      Just don't believe everything you read,
      this is no exception. I try to evaluate motivations when listening to someone. Sure Marc Andreessen seems like a
      wonderful guy but he has bet on AI with a lot of money. He's also a technologist and that leads him to put the
      cart before the horse when considering these rapid advancements
      of technology. It's addicting and gets me excite but that is likely it's intent. Either way my education can't
      really be a deficit. When has knowing more brought you less?
    </p>
    </br>
    <h1>Summer Projects-Education 5/29/24</h1>
    <p class="interests"> This summer I wanted to complete some projects. I didn't want to just google some
      useless app to create that would never be of use. So I talked to some friends who run a discord server. They
      wanted a bot, which there are plenty. The only reason I wanted to build it was because I had told those same
      friends that I was interested in learning Rust. After more discussion they encouraged me to do it. Not for the
      convience or the performance but because IoT and blockchain technology are excellent use cases for Rust. I looked
      at some companies I was interested in and sure enough they had Rust embedded systems engineers. So I've set up my
      developer account and began the learning process. </p>
    <p class="interests">I have to say the syntax was a little jarring. Coming from C#, .JS, and Python I didn't know
      what to think.
      Rust has a notoriously steep learning curve but that's what I felt I needed. In a year or more, I've come to
      realize you can become stagnant in no time. Even a week or two off from school has me scratching my head on
      something I wrote a couple of weeks earlier. Rust has AMAZING libraries with excellent documentation. It is a
      secure language because of the types (so many types) but they're also mutable or immutable. Rust has lifetime,
      ownership, and more things I haven't even reached yet. It's definitely a challenge but enjoying a long process is
      kind of nice, without an end in sight I can learn patiently and let my curiosity take me where I want to go. I
      understand that won't always be a luxury and I'm trying to take advantage.
