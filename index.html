    <H1>On My Mind</H1>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">For some reason the crypto reputation will not deter my interests. I can't shake the
      feeling that great technology is being slept on because content creators and other shady characters decided to rug
      pull their communities. Regardless of the disruption this causes I still see a way forward for this industry. If
      you follow some of the major hedge funds you'll see how much money they have riding on this tech. From
      entertainment, finance, security, data storage, and more, there's massive infrastructure being built. I think the
      public opinion has slowed the progress but what does the general population know about anything? These niche
      environments are where most of the great technologies are built. </p>
    </br>
    <p style="text-indent: 10px;">Most of these changes will likely be answers to the complications that are brought
      about by a wider adoption of AI (llm's mostly). We already see identity fraud, which is not a huge problem now but
      will likely become more problematic as AI technology matures. I think NFTs are a great way to combat this. If you
      think about what an NFT is, it's basically a authenticated object. Something that cannot be changed or
      manipulated, it can however be traded but that isn't impossible to resolve. If local and national government can
      find a way to provide us with a virtual identity, we could be empowered and secure while conducting business on
      the web, and other environments.</p>
    </br>
    <h1>Summer Projects-Education</h1>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;"> This summer I wanted to complete some projects. I didn't want to just google some
      useless app to create that would never be of use. So I talked to some friends who run a discord server. They
      wanted a bot, which there are plenty. The only reason I wanted to build it was because I had told those same
      friends that I was interested in learning Rust. After more discussion they encouraged me to do it. Not for the
      convience or the performance but because IoT and blockchain technology are excellent use cases for Rust. I looked
      at some companies I was interested in and sure enough they had Rust imbedded systems engineers. So I've set up my
      developer account and began the learning process. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px;">I have to say the syntax was a little jarring. Coming from C#, .JS, and Python I didn't know what to think.
      Rust-lang has a notoriously steep learning curve but that's what I felt I needed. In a year or more, I've come to
      realize you can become stagnant in no time. Even a week or two off from school has me scratching my head on
      something I wrote a couple of weeks earlier. Rust has AMAZING libraries with excellent documentation. It is a
      secure language because of the types (so many types) but they're also mutable or immutable. Rust has lifetime,
      ownership, and more things I haven't even reached yet. It's definitely a challenge but enjoying a long process is
      kind of nice, without an end in sight I can learn patiently and let my curiosity take me where I want to go. I
      understand that won't always be a luxury and I'm trying to take advantage.
